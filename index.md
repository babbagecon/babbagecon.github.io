# Babbagecon - A 1 day event for men in security

Babbagecon is an event for men working in the information security industry, designed to discuss male issues that affect all of us but are rarely raised in public spaces. Such spaces already exist for women, but none exist for men making up the majority of industry. We want to change that for the benefit of everyone.

We believe that by discussing the issues men commonly face but rarely feel able to raise in a safe space, we can help men more effectively cope with the health, wealth and personal issues we commonly face in the industry today. By doing this we can make our industry more inclusive for everyone.

## Themes
Key themes for the event include, but are not limited to:

* Improving engagement with women, people of color and marginalized groups
* Harassment and Abuse
* Dealing with work/home-induced stress and anxiety
* Road-based living and health, jobs and relationships
* Break-ups, divorce and child support for security workers
* Fatherhood in a road-based job environment
* Coping with anger and isolation
* Access to male mentoring/role models
* Mental Health issues
* Career breaks
* Bringing men from poverty into security industry

We are also interested in technical workshops particularly around developing technical skills and helping men stay safe online. 

Where possible talks will be filmed. If you would prefer not to be named or filmed this would make us sad but we understand.

## Call for venues
We are currently looking for venues to host the event, please let us know of your interest by sending an email to babbagecon@protonmail.ch. It is our hope that from our structure, men will run babbagecon events in their own spaces worldwide.

We're based in Australia, South Africa and the United States of America but are open to ideas on any space that would support us, providing there are enough men in security willing to come.

## Code of conduct
Our code of conduct is simple. We want this to be an event where everyone can share. It is perfectly fine to disagree. It is perfectly fine to present an alternative idea or view in discussion. It is not ok to harass or shout down others. Because Babbagecon is a place requiring social, emotional and mental depth, we do not have alcohol at the event. We will not tolerate:

* Intoxication or illegal drug abuse
* Harassment, intimidation, verbal or physical abuse
* Acts against individuals or groups of people (e.g. 'isms')
* Violations of personal privacy (e.g. taking photos of people without permission)
* Physical contact that makes the receiver uncomfortable or crosses a personal trust boundary

The above are simply examples and you may be asked to leave at any point by the organisers for any reason. If you don't like this, set up your own babbagecon.

All men are valid here, regardless of orientation, color, sexual origin, religion or political views. This means you may encounter people very different to you, with opposing views and values. Try to find the commonality between you, be friendly and forgiving and you may grow in ways you never imagined. Above all, be kind. If you can't be kind, be silent and listen.

## A point on female participation
We believe that women are underrepresented in industry. Furthermore, women, as with many marginalized groups face discrimination on a daily basis. We dislike discrimination but there are circumstances in which exclusion can be helpful, as with exclusionary events like [Black Hoodie](https://blackhoodie.re/) and [Adaconf](https://adaconf.org/). We hope women understand that the men needing this event the most are less likely to discuss issues surrounding male fragility in an environment with women present. As such this event will be for attendance and participation by men, and transgender people identifying as men only for at least our first event.
