# Babbagecon - A 1 day event for men in security

Babbagecon is an event for men working in the information security industry, designed to discuss male issues that affect all of us but are rarely raised in public spaces. Such spaces already exist for women, but none exist for men, who make up the majority of industry. We want to change that for the benefit of everyone.

We believe that by discussing the issues men commonly face but rarely feel able to raise in a safe space, we can help men more effectively cope with the health, wealth and personal issues we commonly face in the industry today.

## Themes
Key themes for the event include, but are not limited to:

* Improving engagement with women, people of color and marginalized groups
* Harassment and Abuse
* Dealing with work/home-induced stress and anxiety
* Road-based living and health
* Road-based jobs and relationships
* Break-ups, divorce and child support for security workers
* Fatherhood in a road-based job environment
* Coping with anger and isolation
* Access to male mentoring/role models
* Mental Health issues
* Career breaks
* Bringing men from poverty into security industry

## Call for venues
We are currently looking for venues to host the event, please let us know of your interest by sending an email to babbagecon@protonmail.ch. It is our hope that from our structure, men will run babbagecon events in their own spaces worldwide.

## Call for sponsors
We are looking for sponsors for our both our event and to assist in creating a package for people wanting to run thir own babbagecon.

## Call for papers
Our call for papers will open in due course

## Code of conduct
We will present our code of conduct in due course. Please be assured there will be one, and we will not tolerate hate.

## A point on female participation
We believe that women are underrepresented in industry. Furthermore, women, as with many marginalized groups face discrimination on a daily basis. We dislike discrimination but there are circumstances in which exclusion can be helpful, as with exclusionary events like Black Hoodie and Adaconf. We hope women understand that the men needing this event the most are less likely to discuss issues surrounding male fragility in an environment with women present. As such this event will be for attendance and participation by men, and transgender people identifying as men only for at least our first event.
